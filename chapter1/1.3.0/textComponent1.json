I'm currently working on an exhibition about everyday objects and am still collecting some things. Maybe you can help me, I have this data-set of a mortar here, which I found in our database. I'd like to use it in the exhibition, but I'm not sure how it looks like as the data-set doesn't have a picture. This makes it all the more difficult, maybe you can figure out, which of these mortars is the right one.»"
