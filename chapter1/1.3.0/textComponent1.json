I'm currently working on an exhibition of everyday objects and am still collecting some things. Maybe you can help me? I have this dataset of a mortar here, which I found in our database. I'd like to use it in the exhibition, but I'm not sure what it looks like because the dataset doesn't have a picture. This makes it all the more difficult. Maybe you can figure out which of these mortars is the right one?”"
