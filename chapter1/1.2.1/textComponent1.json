Normally Manuela, the conservator, would help me, but she's out today. I heard you've got some sort of historical education, right? That's perfect, as I have to focus on where the hell I am supposed to find space in the basement for all these objects… when I create datasets alone the description is… let's say 'a little lacking', right. But that's not an issue anymore, now that you're here! Look, I'm currently working on this coffee-maker. I already measured it, so you won't have to, it's 25 cm high with a circumference of about 11 cm. It's also pretty light, didn't expect that, right?<br><br>So, what I'd like for you to do is the description in the dataset. Have a good look and write down what you see. Maybe you can also find something out about it on the internet. Take your time, the first time is always difficult, right?»"
