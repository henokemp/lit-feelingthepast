Normally Manuela, the conservator, would help me but she's out today. I heard you've got some sort of historical education, right? That's perfect, as I have to focus on where the hell I am supposed to find space in the basement for all these objects… when I create datasets alone the description is… let's say a little *lacking*, right? But that's not an issue anymore, now that you're here! Look, I'm currently working on this coffee-maker. An older lady came to us a few days ago and had like five of those, which she wanted to give to the museum. Laura and I kept the one in the best condition. The lady kept one for herself and we disposed the others for her. I know, seems a little harsh but this is how it works. If we kept everything we would need at least three times the space we have now. And this basement is already crammed... I already measured the coffee-maker, so you won't have to, it's 25 cm high with a circumference of about 11 cm. It's also pretty light, didn't expect that, right?»<br><br>«So, what I'd like for you to do is the description in the dataset. Have a good look from multiple angles and write down what you see. Maybe you can also find something out about the coffee-maker on the internet, that's sometimes helpful. Maybe an estimate from which decade it is, or who produced them. Take your time, the first time is always difficult, right?»"
