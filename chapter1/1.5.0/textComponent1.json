Ours is the kind of work which has no end... By the way, Timea asked me earlier to take another look at the mortars. Guess what I found? There was an inventory number under some grime! We know for sure now that the dataset is for the golden mortar, I think it was the one standing on the left side. Isn't it great that we figured that one out? You should be done with your first day at work soon, right? You know what, how about a coffee or drink? Sound good? Great! I'll just quickly check something with Laura and then we're good to go!” Frederic rushes off and you remain alone in the collection.<br><br>Suddenly, your phone buzzes."
