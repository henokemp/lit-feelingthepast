  "markdownContent": "You feel a warm breeze moving your hair. The air smells of flowers and in the distance someone is starting up a fire, probably for a late afternoon barbecue. The sky is spotless blue and the temperature---even though warm and humid---feels pleasant on your skin. You're lying on a long and broad sunbed, your face protected by sunscreen and sunglasses. You try to think about nothing and take in everything.<br><br>But you can't.<br><br>In the back of your mind something is bugging you, preventing your body and mind from becoming one with the sunbed and garden: even now, in the summer before your final year as a Master's student, you have no clue about the topic of your MA thesis.<br><br>The last few weeks of the past semester---the time when you'd originally planned to think about a topic---sadly had to be spent finishing up two papers. You met your deadlines, but instead of being able to switch off for a few weeks, you're still restless with all there is to do. At least you've already chosen your supervisor, Professor Alexander Shorter. (He'd said you could just call him Alex, but you find it somewhat weird to be on first-name terms with someone so acclaimed!) In accepting you, he'd explained that he had to spend his free time “somehow”. Strange dude, but great for your CV to have him as your intellectual mentor...<br><br>Suddenly, your phone buzzes with an incoming email."
