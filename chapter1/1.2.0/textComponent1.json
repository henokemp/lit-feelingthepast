  "markdownContent": "“Thanks, see you in the break,” Laura says as she shuts the door to her office. Her office is a rather large room on the first floor of the museum. There are a number of paintings hanging and lying around, as well as some woodblock prints. You've read on the webpage of the museum that she's an art historian specializing in local artists from the 19th century and their interactions with a larger geographical horizon. It feels a little weird being so close to treasures which would normally either be hung behind glass in the gallery or hidden away in a safe. Suddenly, you're able to see individual brush strokes on the oil paintings, or how different multiple copies of the same print can be.<br><br>You notice Laura observing you. “It's funny how ordinary it becomes, being in contact with these objects every day. I remember as a student I was so hesitant to even just touch a painting at first. These amazing works, some centuries old, have something so mystical about them when they're right in front of you. Imagining a human sat in front of this very canvas, mixing colours yet to be used on a palette, and then creating something so beautiful... It gave me goosebumps back then. I'm mean, it still sometimes does, but I have to consciously remind myself of what I have in front of me.”<br><br>Her explanation feels a little too poetic for your taste, but now that you're sitting next to a painting, there is some truth to it."
