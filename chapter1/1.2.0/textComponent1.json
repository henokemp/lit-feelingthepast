  "markdownContent": "«Thanks, see you in break», Laura says as she shuts the door to her office. Her office is a rather large room on the first floor of the museum. There are a number of paintings hanging and lying around, as well as some woodblock-prints. You've read on the webpage of the museum, that she's an art-historian, specialized in local artists from the 19th century and their interaction with a larger geographical horizon. It feels a little weird being so close to things, which would normally be hung inside a gallery and behind glass, or hidden away in a safe. You're able to see individual brush strokes on the oil paintings and how different multiple copies of the same prints can be. You notice Laura's observing you.<br><br>«It's funny how ordinary it becomes, being in contact with these objects everyday. I remember as a student at first I was so hesitant to even just touch a painting. These amazing works, some centuries old, have something so mystical about them, when they are in front of you. Imagining that a human sat in front of this very canvas, with these colours – yet to be used – on a plate and then created something so beautiful, gave me chills back then. I'm mean, it still sometimes does, but I have to consciously remind myself, what I have in front of me.»<br><br>It feels a little too poetic for your taste, but there is some truth to it, now that you're sitting next to a painting.<br><br>«But enough of me rambling, let's get you to work. I guess, you've never been the one to fill a database, only use it, right? So I think for your first job, you should help Frederic with creating some data-sets. You should find him in the basement, he's always thrilled to have some help."
