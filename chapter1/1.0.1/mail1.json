Regarding that: Do you already have an idea, what the topic's supposed to be? I'm of course giving you complete creative control, but please have a rough research outline ready soon.  That way we can keep developing good ideas and do some gooood work.<br><br>In other news: My friend Laura, who's the director of the Von-Ranke-Museum, is looking for an intern. It's over summer, so I thought it would be perfect for you. Maybe you'll get some good ideas while working. I told her over dinner last night about your past few papers and she was thrilled to get to know you!<br><br>So give her a call and say, who you are, so you can start next Monday.<br><br>All the best and talk to you soon<br><br>- Alex -"
