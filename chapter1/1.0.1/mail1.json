I'll of course give you complete creative control, but please have a rough research outline ready soon. That way we can keep developing good ideas together.<br><br>In other news: My friend Laura, who's the director of the Von-Ranke-Museum, is looking for an intern. It's over summer, so I thought it would be perfect for you. Maybe you'll get some good ideas while working for her. I told her and the collection manager over dinner last night about your past few papers and they were thrilled to hear about you.<br><br>Give her a call and say who you are, so that you can start next Monday.<br><br>All best and talk soon<br><br>- Alex -"
