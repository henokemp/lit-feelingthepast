I guess if you study history, you really do learn how to have a good look at objects.”<br><br>“By the way, I talked to Laura while you were doing your description, and she wants you to help Timea for a bit. Ah, sorry: she's the curator. You'll find her on the first floor in one of the historical rooms. Again, thanks so much for your help!”"
