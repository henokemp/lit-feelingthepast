He told me that you're interested in medical tools, so I went and checked if we have anything interesting in our collection.»<br><br>«I found something actually just next to the shelf I was working at anyway, so I quickly picked it up. It's some sort of apothecary scale in a wooden box. I've set it up for you next to these shelves. The other thing I found sadly only has some digital information, no clue where it is, at least not at the location noted in the dataset. Probably somewhere in an office of a curator, who forgot to put the temporary location into the database… like always. It's an ventilator from, my guess, the second half of the 20th century, but I'm far from an expert. Last but not least, I remembered having something interesting at my last workplace. It's a straitjacket from the local public hospital. Isn't that cool? The digital information is… let's say a little unconventional, but I got you a copy anyway. The database at that place was filled with texts from different people simply writing about the objects, in most cases historians or conservators. The datasets read both like a dataset and a history book. I'm not so sure about what the benefit of this is supposed to be. Maybe you can do more with it. Oh yeah, Alex also told me that you should think about 'what do these objects tell you' and 'think of objects just like written sources' or something.»<br><br>«Which one do you want to check out?»"
