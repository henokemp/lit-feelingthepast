He told me that you're interested in medical tools, so I went and checked, if we have anything interesting in our collection.<br><br>I found something actually just next to the shelf I was working at anyway, so I quickly picked it up. The other thing I found sadly only has some digital information, no clue where it is, at least not at the location noted in data-set. Probably somewhere in an office of a curator, who forgot to put the temporary location into the database… Last but not least, I remember having something interesting at my last workplace, even though the digital information is… let's say a little unconventional, but I got you a copy anyways.<br><br>So, which one do you want to check out?»"
