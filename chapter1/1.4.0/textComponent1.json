He told me that you're interested in medical tools, so I went and checked if we have anything interesting in our collection.”<br><br>“I actually found something right next to the shelf I was working at anyway, so I quickly picked it up. It's some sort of apothecary scale in a wooden box. I've set it up for you next to these shelves. Unfortunately, the other thing I found only has some digital information. I've no clue where it is---at the very least, it's not at the location noted in the dataset. It's probably somewhere unreturned in a curator's office, as always... Anyway, it's a ventilator from, I guess, the second half of the 20th century, but I'm far from being an expert.”<br><br>“Lastly, I remembered having something interesting at my previous workplace. It's a straitjacket from the local public hospital. Isn't that cool? The digital information is, er, a little unconventional, but I got you a copy anyway. The database at that place was filled with texts from different people simply writing about the objects, in most cases historians or conservators. The datasets read both like a dataset and a history book. I'm not so sure what the benefit of this is supposed to be. Maybe you can do more with it.”<br><br>You're overwhelmed by---and grateful for---all these new ideas. Which of Frederic's objects do you want to examine?"
