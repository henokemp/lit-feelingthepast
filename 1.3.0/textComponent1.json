I'm currently working on an exhibition about TOPIC and am still collecting some objects. Maybe you can help me finding some of them. I have this data-set here, which I found in our database. I'd like to use it in the exhibition, but I'm not sure how it looks like as the data-set doesn't have a picture. This makes it all the more difficult, maybe you can figure out, which object relates to this data-set.»"
