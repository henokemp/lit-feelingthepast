## The Idea
This is the repository for my chapter in the Lives in Transit game based on the Marugoto engine. The main concept is introducing more objects as sources into historical research. With using the narrative structure of Marugoto, the player will be confronted with a number of tasks, which have the goal to facilitate critical thinking about, how historians use objects as sources in their research.

## The Game
The game has a playtime of between 15 and 30 minutes, depending on your playstyle. The contents are loosely based on my own experience doing an internship at the museum. The exercises are based on real work I've done in the museum. The goal was to have the player be confronted with real problems in working with objects and data-sets in a museum environment. 

## Resources

All used pictures except the garden picture, which is free license, were made by myself, my workplace (Historisches und VÃ¶lkerkundemuseum St.Gallen), or the Lives in Transit team.
