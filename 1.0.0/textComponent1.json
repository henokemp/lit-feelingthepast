  "markdownContent": "You feel a warm breeze moving you hair. The air smells like flowers and in the distance someone is starting up a fire, probably for a late afternoon barbecue. The sky is filled with a spotless blue and the temperature – even though warm and humid – feels pleasant on your skin. You're lying on a long and broad sunbed, your face protected by sunscreen and sunglasses. You try to think about nothing and just take in everything.<br><br>But you can't.<br><br>In the back of your head there is something bugging you, keeping your body and mind from becoming one with the sunbed and garden you're lying in: It's the summer before your last year at university, but you don't have a clue, which topic your Master's thesis should be about.<br><br>The last few weeks of the past semester – the time, in which you originally planned to think about a topic – sadly had to be spend finishing up two papers. You started early and continuously worked on them since February, but the last 10 percent – as always – were pretty time-consuming. Luckily, they were finished on time and now you have a summer all to yourself – if there weren't your Master's thesis making you a little restless. At least you already have chosen your supervisor, Alexander Shorter, though he said you could just call him Alex. Kinda weird for someone so acclaimed as him, not only in his official field, but others as well! According to him «he has to spend his free-time somehow». Strange dude, but to have him as the supervisor for my Master's thesis will look great on my CV.<br><br>Suddenly, your phone buzzes."
